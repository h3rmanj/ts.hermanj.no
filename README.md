# ts.hermanj.no bot

This repo contains a discord bot written with [Discord.Net](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net).
The goal of the bot is to make our transition from TeamSpeak to Discord as smooth as possible.

## Features

### Voice Text Channels

The bot will create text channels for each voice channel, which only the participants of the voice channel will have access to.
This is similar to the way TeamSpeak handles text channels.

### Custom Colors

React to a message from the bot to set a custom color in the user list.
